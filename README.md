# Tic Tac Toe Game üéÆ

Welcome to the **Tic Tac Toe Game**, a classic game you can play in your terminal! This Python-powered implementation lets you challenge your friends or play against the computer (with a little random AI thrown in!). The game was built for study purposes using Python functions along with the `os` and `random` modules to clear the terminal and create some randomness for the computer player.

## üöÄ Features
- **Two-player mode:** Play with a friend in classic Tic Tac Toe style.
- **Single-player mode:** Challenge a simple computer AI (random moves).
- **Terminal-based:** The game runs directly in your terminal, no GUI needed!
- **Function-based design:** The game logic is neatly organized into functions to keep the code modular and easy to follow.
